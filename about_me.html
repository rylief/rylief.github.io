		Hi, I'm Rylie Foster. I have a B.A. in Mathematics and Computer Science from Reed College, and<br>
		I'm interested in machine learning, equation-free modeling, and the ethical and safe development<br>
		of data science and AI tools.<br>
		<br>
		I'm especially interested in applying tools from data-driven dynamical systems to ecological data,<br>
		and developing explainable models for the interactions between climate and biodiversity in<br>
		specific ecological systems.<br>
